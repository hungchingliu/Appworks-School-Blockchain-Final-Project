# Appworks-School-Blockchain-Final-Project
- Description
    - The primary goal of this project is to understand the Uniswap V4 codebase and develop additional functionality on top of it. After brainstorming, I have come up with the following directions:
        - IUniSwapV4Router for Uniswap V4: This component will encapsulate the primary interactions with Uniswap V4, allowing seamless integration and interaction with the protocol.
        - Custom Hooks with Customized Functionality: I plan to develop custom hooks that offer personalized functionality.
